Database Structure
==================

A metabolite database is represented by two types of files: a struct and a mapping. These databases are used in the
annotation process ran by SmartPeak.

Both files are in :abbr:`TSV (tab-separated values)` format. Functions to handle these files have to be imported from
the ``io`` module.
